# e-Bookstore App

 - Clone using `git clone https://github.com/benbouba/bookstore.git`
 - `cd bookstore` to go into the app root folder.
 - `npm install` to install all dependencies.  

## Scripts to run the app

In the cloned folder run:

### `npm run dev`

This will run the app in and open in browser<br>
If that does not happen, open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the app in browser.

Alternatively, you can run:
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

You can also run:

### `npm run lint`
This script will run through the code and fix any lint issues
